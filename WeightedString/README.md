# Weighted String C# Solution
## Instructions

**A = 1  
B = 2*A + A  
C = 3*B + B  
D = 4*C + C  
.  
.  
.  
.  
Y = 25*X + X  
Z = 26*Y + Y**  

Given a number(weight) as input, smallestString() method should return the shortest possible string to achieve the weight given

EX: given weight is 30
from above instructions, we know A = 1, B = 3, C = 12, D = 60 ... etc

Multiple strings below are of weight 30, But the shortest string is CCBB
You can represent it in any combination such as BBCC, BCBC, CBCB etc.
